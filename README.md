# genetic algorithms
python implementetion (and visualization) of genetic algorithm and sample solutions and some visualizations in jupyter environment

ga.py : core GA library implementationi other files use this as a GA engine.

ga_on_script_demo.py: sample optimizationns performed on script

ga_demo (html & ipynb): interactive demo, genes are diplayed using pandas, optimizations performed and results are presented 

ga_visual: optimizations are performed on arbitrary datasets, classifications made by GA are visualized both by best gene and by the entire population.
