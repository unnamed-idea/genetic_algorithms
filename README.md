# genetic algorithms
python implementetion (and visualization) of genetic algorithm and sample solutions and some visualizations in jupyter environment

ga.py : core GA library implementationi other files use this as a GA engine.

ga_on_script_demo.py: sample optimizationns performed on script

ga_demo (html & ipynb): interactive demo, genes are diplayed using pandas, optimizations performed and results are presented 

ga_visual: optimizations are performed on arbitrary datasets, classifications made by GA are visualized both by best gene and by the entire population.

Schwefel Function in which gradient based methods fail to converge to the global min, but GA does so successfully.

Although being inefficient /not robust enogh, the same GA algorithm can be used for classification (either linear or n.th-degree poly)
